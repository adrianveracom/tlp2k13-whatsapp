This is just an exercise to show the attendees of my talk at @tlp_innova http://tlp-innova.com/items/construye-whatsapp-en-90-min-con-html5-javascript/ how to build a small whatsapp app with node.js and socket.io.


###How to use the example

2. Execute npm -i install and download de dependencies
3. Execute "node app.js" and let the server running

##### Client side

1. Open the index.html file in two different browsers and add at the end of the file url #user and in the other one #friend
2. Start chatting!
